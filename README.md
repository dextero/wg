# Warlock's Gauntlet

Mirror of https://bitbucket.org/toxic/wg

Warlock's Gauntlet is a dynamic, top-down shooter (well, spell-caster) game, placing you - the player - in the role of a battlemage. The hero travels through maps filled with monsters, gaining experience and learning new spells. The game is similar to titles like Gauntlet or Diablo. The game features 25 random-generated levels which should amount to about three hours of gameplay; the player character can find over 60 distinct spells. There is no networked multiplayer, but the game includes a hot-seat two-player mode. The game available entirely for free - the code is open source and the assets are licensed CC.
