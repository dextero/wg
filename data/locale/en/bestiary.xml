	</entry>
	<entry>
		<key>BESTIARY_CHITYNIAK_DESC</key>
		<value>An armored rodent-insect hybrid. It&apos;s fast and poisonous. A single Chitin warrior should be easy to keep at a distance; a group, however, could easily corner and overwhelm the unsuspecting adventurer.</value>

		<value>Crawler</value>
	</entry>
	<entry>

	<entry>
		<key>BESTIARY_HEALER_GHOST_DESC</key>
		<value>This is a monster? I don&apos;t think so. It heals the player, doesn&apos;t try to eat him... definitely not a monster. Then what&apos;s it doing in the bestiary, eh?</value>

		<value>Hornet</value>
	</entry>
	<entry>
		<key>BESTIARY_HORNET_DESC</key>
		<value>An extremely dangerous hornet-rodent hybrid. A flock of these would be really hard to beat, since they&apos;re quite speedy and resistant. What&apos;s more, their venom cripples and slows down the victim.</value>

	</entry>
	<entry>
		<key>BESTIARY_OGRE_WIFE_DESC</key>
		<value>The ogrette, as the eastern magi call her, is a strong, loud, hateful monster full of spite and malice. Not exactly smart, though. Just keep your distance and you&apos;ll be fine.</value>
