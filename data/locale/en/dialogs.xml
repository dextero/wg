		<key>DLG_TUTORIAL1_2</key>
		<value>In the classic control scheme, arrows are used to move. You can change controls at any time using Options in the Pause menu [Esc].
The control scheme you chose is listed under the information screen under %1 (for the second player - %2)
		
Pick up the item in front of you by moving on to it.</value>

		<key>DLG_TUTORIAL3_1</key>

		<value>The road in front of you is blocked - you must clear it to go past. In your journey you will find many places like this - some require to kill certain monster or clearing entire map, others only need to place the foot in the right place.</value>

		<key>DLG_TUTORIAL4_2</key>
		<value>This passage is guarded by the old rat Zenek. Faithfully did he spend his entire life in the service of... in fact, it is not known whom he served (he didn&apos;t say - he doesn&apos;t speak human), but his age is wearing upon him. Relieve him of his suffering, so he can go to rat heaven (and allow you to go past).</value>

		<key>DLG_TUTORIAL4_3</key>
		<value>Monsters can drop many useful items after death. It is worth looking at; in some situations they can save your butt.
Furthermore, throughout the maps there are powerful yellow orbs, holding the power of ancient spells.
		
During your travels you will also find lairs, which will spawn more monsters. Dealing with them early makes the game easier in overall.</value>

		<key>DLG_TUTORIAL5_1</key>
		<value>You have just advanced to the next level!

With each level gained you earn a skill point. You can use it to upgrade your spells or to learn new ones using the screen opened with [%1] ([%2] for the second player).</value>

	<entry>
		<key>DLG_TUTORIAL5_2</key>
		<value>One last thing - support and special spells can be cast without using slots, by quickly entering the combination displayed in the ability window.</value>
	</entry>
	<entry>
		<key>DLG_TUTORIAL6_1</key>
		<value>This is all you need to know. Step into the green portal to start your adventure.

Good luck!</value>

		<key>DLG_NPC_HINT_MAGIC_SCHOOLS</key>
		<value>There are four magic disciplines: melancholic, sanguine, choleric and phlegmatic. Training in one of them improves some spells, but may decrease the power of others, so be careful!</value>
	</entry>
	<entry>
		<key>DLG_NPC_HINT_MAGIC_SCHOOLS2</key>
		<value>To master a spell one has to develop the four magic elements in exact proportions. However, for each spell these proportion are different so it's not possible to be a master in all.</value>
	</entry>
	<entry>
		<key>DLG_NPC_HINT_SPELLS</key>
		<value>Somebody *really* should find a way to cast spells without using these damn spellbooks. It&apos;s just impossible to have more than four at a time and I&apos;m often forced to throw away some spells to be able to use a new one. I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll soon face the same problem, my friend...</value>
	</entry>
	<entry>
		<key>DLG_NPC_HINT_MANACOST</key>
		<value>When improving your spell mastery you need to remember that casting will cost you more mana. Sometimes it is a good idea to keep your mastery low, or even consciously lower it, so that you can cast the spell multiple times during the heat of battle. </value>

		<key>DLG_NPC_HINT_DRAGON</key>
		<value>Wanderers spread rumors about a dragon hiding in the Frozen Wastelands east of here. It&apos;s always been a dangerous place, but a monster so powerful? If it&apos;s true, we'll need somebody to get rid of it.</value>
	</entry>
	<entry>
		<key>DLG_NPC_HINT_DRAGON2</key>
		<value>I've heard a green dragon was seen east of town. I wonder what it eats - you can&apos;t really find many maidens around here lately.</value>
	</entry>
	<entry>
		<key>DLG_NPC_HINT_FROZEN_WASTELANDS_MONSTERS</key>
		<value>Undead beasts inhabiting the Frozen Wasteland&apos;s are immune to all kinds of poisons. Our greatest sages are trying to find out why, but so far they have no clue.</value>
	</entry>
	<entry>
		<key>DLG_NPC_HINT_HOSTILE_CREATURES</key>
		<value>Monsters from the Frozen Wastelands have become aggresive lately and started attacking Gargant Forest and Forgotten Lands. Be careful if you&apos;re going there - every single intruder is now considered a threat, so you&apos;ll face hordes of hostile creatures wherever you go.</value>
	</entry>
	<entry>
		<key>DLG_NPC_HINT_GARGANT_FOREST</key>
		<value>As an unexperienced mage, you should start by visiting the Gargant Forest to the south. There you&apos;ll find many ingredients that could be useful, and monsters are not so tough there as in the northern territories.</value>
	</entry>
	<entry>
		<key>DLG_NPC_HINT_MAP</key>
		<value>Paths between nearby territories are somewhat strange. You should really get a map to avoid getting lost... Here, take mine. (press F5 whenever you want to check your current location)</value>
	</entry>
	<entry>
		<key>DLG_NPC_HINT_SHOPS</key>
		<value>Some of the town folk may have a spell for sale. You should check with them each time you are in town - they might have something different on offer.</value>
